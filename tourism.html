        <p>New Haven's greatest culinary claim to fame may be its pizza, which has
          been claimed to be among the best in the country, or even in the world.
          New Haven-style pizza, called "apizza", made its debut at the iconic Frank
          Pepe Pizzeria Napoletana (known as Pepe's) in 1925. Apizza is baked in 
          coal- or wood-fired brick ovens, and is notable for its thin crust. Apizza
          may be red (with a tomato-based sauce) or white (with a sauce of garlic 
          and olive oil), and pies ordered "plain" are made without the otherwise
          customary mozzarella (originally smoked mozzarella, known as "scamorza" in
          Italian). A white clam pie is a well-known specialty of the restaurants on
          Wooster Street in the Little Italy section of New Haven, including Pepe's 
          and Sally's Apizza (which opened in 1938). Modern Apizza on State Street, 
          which opened in 1934, is also well-known.</p>
